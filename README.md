Contagion
=========

Contagion is a remake of the popular app, Plague Inc. Your creation is a wee little pathogen; your destination is total human obliteration. Starting with Patient Zero in a country of your choosing, you must bring the human race to extinction by evolving a deadly, global Contagion whilst adapting against what humanity has to offer. Your Contagion will meet with fierce retaliation, and it is up to you to decide: will you be the prey or will you be the predator. [*cue dramatic music *] This is Operation Mockingbird, and this is Contagion.
